We are a group of over 100 Hoxton West residents working together on a completely voluntary basis to help our community during the coronavirus outbreak. We know how challenging this time is, whether you are in self-isolation and unable to shop for yourself, missing friends and family and need someone to talk to or unable to walk your pets. These are all things that we can help with!

On 15 March 2020, a few residents clubbed together to set us up. We now have over 100 volunteers (and counting!) who are providing assistance to their fellow Hoxton West residents. Our aim is to support all residents who need us, either by assisting directly with shopping collections, walking pets or calling anyone who needs to hear a friendly voice at this difficult time.
