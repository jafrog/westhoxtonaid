All requests are logged centrally by our admin team and then passed to an appropriate volunteer, usually one who lives within a few streets of the person requesting assistance. The volunteer will then get in touch to talk through the task and, if relevant, discuss payment arrangements.

We do not ask for money for our services, only for the goods that we might buy for you, and we ask our volunteers to keep copies of all receipts for you to see before you make payment. We try to stick to bank transfer payments to limit risk of infection but we understand that online transfers are not always possible. Where they are not possible, we will talk to the people requesting and giving help beforehand to decide on the best way forward and we will always try to prioritise the needs of those requesting help. We are currently considering different approaches to payments, and will let you know of any updates.

We provide our volunteers with hygiene and safety guidance and strongly encourage them to follow it. We ask in return only that the generosity and health of our volunteers is respected and that care is taken not to pass the virus to others if you are feeling unwell. Equally, if you are a volunteer and you start to feel unwell, please let us know immediately.

Please only share personal information with us if you are happy for it to be shared with the volunteer assigned to you. Having said that, we will only pass on personal information to volunteers that is strictly necessary to complete their task.
