We don't and will not work in conjunction with any enforcement agencies or authorities, including the Home Office, Department for Work and Pensions and any other agency who pose a threat to people's right to access support and care as and when needed. We expect all members to adhere to this and will remove anyone from our group found to be working outside of the guidance and collective guidelines.
