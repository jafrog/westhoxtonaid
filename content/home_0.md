Are you self-isolating due to coronavirus or know someone who is? Do you need someone to run errands, walk your dog or to talk to if you are feeling lonely? Or do you want to volunteer to help your local community through the challenges of coronavirus?

We can help!

We are Hoxton West Mutual Aid, a group of local residents operating in the Hoxton West ward of Hackney, and we are here to support you at this time. We offer our help completely free. You can read more about us and our set-up [here](/about). Please note that all our volunteers are asked to follow strict hygiene and safeguarding protocols when volunteering, which you can find out more about [here](/health).
