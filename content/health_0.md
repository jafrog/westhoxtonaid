We ask all our volunteers to operate in accordance with strict hygiene, data
protection, payment and safeguarding protocol when carrying out assistance work.
One of our coordinators goes through this protocol with all volunteers before they
carry out any task. We are currently compiling this guidance into one document
which will be available here in a few days' time.
